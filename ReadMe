Program to calculate the factor of stresses' concentration Kt.
The formulation of the calculus' model has been created starting by
graphs. These have been digitalized and then adapted to a
mathematical model using numeric methods.
There is no warranty of the accuracy of the values in output of this
program, and the author assumes no responsability for the use of this
application. 
At this moment there is implemented only one model, relative to a
circular section with axial forces, may be in the future more models
will be added, if you want to contribute feel free to write the code
for other models.
